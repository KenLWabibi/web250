        <h2>Course Contract</h2>
        <p> I, <a href="introduction.html">Ken L. Wabibi</a>, agree to abide by the terms in my Spring 2025 WEB250-N801 Database 
            Driven Website Course with my instructor, Professor D.I. von Briesen.</p>
       
        <p> I understand that all work that I do on my school and personal websites will be publicly available to the world. 
            I will not put information there that is inappropriate for schoolwork, or that I wish to keep private.</p> 

        <p> I also understand that it is my work that counts for attendance, not logins or showing up for class. 
            As such, failure to turn in assignments may show as absences.</p>

        <p><i>Signed: Ken L. Wabibi, 19 January 2025</i></p>
